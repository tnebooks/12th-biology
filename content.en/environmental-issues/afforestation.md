**Afforestation Objectives** 

- To increase forest cover, planting more trees, increases O2 production and air quality. 
- Rehabilitation of degraded forests to increase carbon fixation and reducing CO2 from atmosphere.
- Raising bamboo plantations. - Mixed plantations of minor forest produce and medicinal plants. 
- Regeneration of indigenous herbs / shrubs. 
- Awareness creation, monitoring and evaluation. 
- To increase the level and availability of water
table or ground water and also to reduce nitrogen leaching in soil and nitrogen contamination of drinking water, thus making it pure not polluted with nitrogen.
- Nature aided artificial regeneration.

**Achievements** 

- Degraded forests were restored 
- Community assets like overhead tanks bore-wells, hand pumps, community halls, libraries, etc were established
- Environmental and ecological stability was maintained.
- Conserved bio-diversity, wildlife and genetic resources.
- Involvement of community especially women in forest management.

Case study

**Tamil Nadu Afforestation Project (TAP)** With an aim of ecological restoration and biological up-gradation of degraded forests and other lands, the government of Tamil Nadu launched the project in 2 phases Tap I (1997-2005). It aimed to uplift the quality and life of villagers abutting forest areas and to resolve the degraded forests in Tamil Nadu. This is a massive Joint Forest Management Programme. TAP II (2005- 2013) had 2 main objectives. - To restore the ecological equilibrium of the forests, watersheds and adjacent villages of Tamil Nadu. - To improve the quality of the life of inhabitants through reforestation, water conservation and sustained community action.
