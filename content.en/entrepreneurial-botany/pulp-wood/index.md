The term paper is derived from the word ‘papyrus’ a plant (_Cyperus papyrus_) that was used by Egyptians to make paper-like materials. Paper production is a Chinese invention. The Chinese discovered the paper that was prepared from the inner bark of paper mulberry in 105 A.D. For a long time, the art of paper making remained a monopoly of the Chinese until Arabs learned the technique and improved it around 750 A.D. Invention of printing increased the demand for paper.
