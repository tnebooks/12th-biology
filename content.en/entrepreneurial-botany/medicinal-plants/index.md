Medicinal Plants

## Medicinal Plants

India is a treasure house of medicinal plants. They are linked to local heritage as well as to global-trade. All institutional systems in India primarily use medicinal plants as drug sources. At present, 90% collection of medicinal plants is from the non-cultivated sources. Growing demand for herbal products has led to quantum jump in volume of plant materials traded within and across the countries. Increasing demand exerts a heavy strain on the existing resources. Now efforts are being made to introduce cultivation techniques of medicinal plants to the farmers.

Medicinal plants play a significant role in providing primary health care services to rural and tribal people. They serve as therapeutic agents as well as important raw materials for the manufacture of traditional and modern medicines. Medicinally useful molecules obtained from plants that are marketed as drugs are called Biomedicines. Medicinal plants which are marketed as powders or in other modified forms are known as Botanical medicines.
