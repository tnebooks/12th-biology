Food plants
## Food plants

Currently about 10,000 food plants are being used of which only around 1,500 species were brought under cultivation. However, food base of majority of the population depends only on three grass species namely rice, wheat and maize.

### Cereals
The word cereal is derived from Ceres, which according to the Roman mythology denotes “Goddess of agriculture”. All cereals are members of grass family (Poaceae) that are grown for their edible starchy seeds. The prominence of cereals as food plants is due to the following attributes:

- Greater adaptability and successful colonisation on every type of habitat.
- The relative ease of cultivation
- Tillering property that produce more branches which results in higher yield per unit area.
- Compact and dry grains that they can be easily handled, transported and stored without undergoing spoilage.
- High caloric value that provides energy. 
  
The nutrients provided by cereals include carbohydrates, proteins, fibres and a wide range of vitamins and minerals. Cereals can be classified into two different types based on their size namely Major Cereals and Minor Cereals.

#### Major Cereals 

![M](10.1.png "")

**Rice / Paddy** 
Botanical name : _Oryza sativa_

Paddy is a semi-aquatic crop and is grown in standing water. It is an important food crop of the world, occupying the second position in terms of area under cultivation and production, next to wheat. Rice is the chief source of carbohydrate. 
**Origin and Area of cultivation**
South East Asia is considered as the center of origin of rice. Earliest evidences of rice cultivation have been found in China, India and Thailand. It is mainly cultivated in Delta and irrigated regions of Tamil Nadu. 
**Uses** 
Rice is the easily digestible calorie rich cereal food which is used as a staple food in Southern and North East India. Various rice products such as **Flaked rice** (Aval), **Puffed rice** / **parched rice** (Pori) are used as breakfast cereal or as snack food in different parts of India. 

**Rice bran oil** obtained from the rice bran is used in culinary and industrial purposes. 

**Husks** are used as fuel, and in the manufacture of packing material and fertilizer.

**International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)** 

International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) is located in Los Banos, Manila the capital city of Philippines. This is the only institute in the world which exclusively carries out research as on rice. IRRI aims to improve livelihoods and nutrition, abolishing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. Whatever IR rice varieties available in the world are developed through rice breeding programme and released by IRRI. Till date IRRI has produced 843 rice varieties that have been released in 77 countries. IR8 is a high-yielding semi-dwarf rice variety developed by IRRI in the early 1960s and it is called as miracle rice, much celebrated for fighting famine. Another variety to mention is IR36 which is a semi-dwarf variety that proved highly resistant to a number of insect pests and diseases that raised farmers’ rice yields and brought down the prices of the staple food in Asian families. The International Rice Gene bank of IRRI has a collection of more than 117 000 types of rice, comprising of modern and traditional varieties including wild relatives of Paddy.

**Why do popcorn pops?** 

![popcorn](popcorn.png "")

Endosperm in corn consists of two type namely soft and hard. In popcorn soft endosperm constitutes most part of the grain surrounded by thin layer of hard endosperm. When heated, the internal starch and protein are converted into gelatinous substances and when pressure mount further, the soft endosperm expands and explodes reversing the grain and the gelatinous starch are converted into foam, which readily solidifies outside and convert into crispy, tasty popcorn.  
```

**Uses** Most of the corn produced is used as fodder than food. Corn syrup is used in the manufacture of infant foods. Corn is a raw material in the industrial production of alcohol and alcoholic beverages.

### Nuts
Nuts are simple dry fruits composed of a hard shell and an edible kernel. They are packed with a good source of healthy fats, fibre, protein, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Some of the important nuts are discussed below.

![Nuts](10.8.png "")

**Cashew nut**

### Sugars

![Sugars](10.9.png "")

We experienced sweetness while eating the stems of sugarcane, roots of sugar beet, fruits of apple and while drinking palmyra sap. This is due to the different proportions of sugars found in it. Sugar is the generic name for sweet tasting soluble carbohydrate, which are used in foods and beverages. Sugars found in sugarcane and palmyra make them ideal for efficient extraction to make commercial sugar.

**Sugarcane** 
Botanical name : Saccharum officinarum
Family : Poaceae

**Origin and Area of cultivation**
The cultivated Saccharum officinarum has evolved by repeated back crossing of _S.officinarum of New Guinea with wild S.spontaneum_ of India to improve the quality. All districts except Kanyakumari and Nilgiris of Tamil Nadu cultivate Sugarcane. 

**Uses** 
Sugar cane is the raw material for extracting white sugar. Sugarcane supports large number of industries like sugar mills producing refined sugars, distilleries producing liquor grade ethanol and millions of jaggery manufacturing units. Fresh sugarcane juice is a refreshing drink. Molasses is the raw material for the production of ethyl alcohol.

**Stevia /Sweet leaf** 
Botanical name : _Stevia rebaudiana_ Family: Asteraceae Stevia is a sweetener and a sugar substitute, extracted from the leaves of _Stevia rebaudiana._ It has no calories and is 200 times sweeter than sugar. The Steveocide is the chemical that is responsible for sweetness in Stevia.


**Origin and Area of cultivation**
Stevia is a native to Brazil and Paraguay. It is cultivated in the states of Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.

Family: Arecaceae

**Origin and Area of cultivation**
Palmyra is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia and New Guinea. Palmyra grows all over Tamil Nadu, especially in coastal districts. 

**Uses** 
Exudate from inflorescence axis is collected for preparing palm sugar. Inflorescence is tapped for its sap which is used as health drink. Sap is processed to get palm jaggery or fermented to give **toddy**. Endosperm is used as a refreshing summer food. Germinated seeds have an elongated embryo surrounded by fleshy scale leaf which is edible.

### Oil Seeds
Why fried foods are tastier than boiled foods? There are two kinds of oils namely, essential oils and vegetable oils or fatty oils. The essential oils or volatile oils which possess aroma evaporate or volatilize in contact with air. Any organ of a plant may be the source of essential oil. For example, flowers of Jasmine, fruits of orange and roots of ginger. The vegetable oils or non-volatile oils or fixed oils that do not evaporate. Whole seeds or endosperm form the sources of vegetable oils.
