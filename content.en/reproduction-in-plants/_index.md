One of the essential features of all living things on the earth is reproduction. Reproduction is a vital process for the existence of a species and it also brings suitable changes through variation in the offsprings for their survival on earth. Plant reproduction is important not only for its own survival but also for the continuation and existence of all other organisms since the latter directly or indirectly depend on plants. Reproduction also plays an important role in evolution.

In this unit let us learn in detail about reproduction in plants.
Basically reproduction occurring in organisms fall under two major categories 

1. Asexual reproduction 
2. Sexual reproduction.
