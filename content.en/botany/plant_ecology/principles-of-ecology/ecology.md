The term “ecology” **(oekologie)** is derived from two Greek words – **oikos** (meaning house or dwelling place and **logos** meaning study) It was first proposed by Reiter (1868). However, the most widely accepted definition of ecology was given by **Ernest Haeckel** (1869).

**Alexander von Humbolt** - Father of Ecology

**Eugene P. Odum** - Father of modern Ecology

**R. Misra** - Father of Indian Ecology

#### Definitions of ecology

> “The study of living organisms, both plants and animals, in their natural habitats or homes.” **\- Reiter (1885)**

> “Ecology is the study of the reciprocal relationship between living organisms and their environment.” **\- Earnest Haeckel (1889)**

#### Ecological hierarchy

The interaction of organisms with their environment results in the establishment of grouping of organisms which is called ecological hierarchy or ecological levels of organization. The basic unit of ecological hierarchy is an individual organism. The hierarchy of ecological systems is illustrated below:

#### Branches of Ecology:

Ecology is mainly divided into two branches, they are autecology and synecology

**1\. Autecology** is the ecology of an individual species and is also called species ecology.

**2\. Synecology** is the ecology of a population or community with one or more species and also called as community ecology.

Many advances and developments in the field ecology resulted in various new dimensions and branches. Some of the advanced fields are Molecular ecology, Eco technology, Statistical ecology and Environmental toxicology

#### Habitat and Niche

**Habitat** Habitat is a specific physical place or locality occupied by an organism or any species which has a particular combination of abiotic or environmental factors. But the environment of any community is called **Biotope.**

**Niche**

An ecological niche refers to an organism’s place in the biotic environment and its functional role in an ecosystem. The term was coined by the naturalist **Roswell Hill Johnson but Grinell** (1917) was probably first to use this term. The habitat and niche of any organism is called **Ecotope**

**The differences between habitat and niche are as follows.**

\*\*Habitat\*\*

\*\*Niche\*\*

1.

A specific  
physical space  
occupied by  
an organism  
(species)

A functional space  
occupied by an  
organism in the same  
eco-system

2.

Same habitat  
may be shared by  
many organisms  
(species)

A single niche is  
occupied by a single  
species

3.

Habitat  
specificity is  
exhibited by  
organism

Organisms may  
change their niche  
with time and season

**Applied ecology or environmental technology :**

Application of the Science of ecology is otherwise called as **Applied ecology** or **Environmental technology.** It helps us to manage and conserve natural resources, particularly ecosystems, forest and wild life conservative and management. Environmental management involves Bio-diversity conservation, Ecosystem restoration, Habitat management, Invasive species management, Protected areas management and also help us plan landscapes and environmental impact designing for the futuristic ecology.

#### Ecological equivalents

Taxonomically different species occupying similar habitats (Niches) in different geographical regions are called **Ecological equivalents.**

**Examples:**

*   Certain species of epiphytic orchids of Western Ghats of India differ from the epiphytic orchids of South America. But they are epiphytes.
*   Species of the grass lands of Western Ghats of India differ from the grass species of temperate grass lands of Steppe in North America. But they are all ecologically primary producers and fulfilling similar roles in their respective communities.
