The land and water of the earth sustain a vast assemblage of plants upon which all other living forms are directly or indirectly dependent. Pre-historic humans lived on berries, tubers, herbage, and the wild game which they collected and hunted that occupied whole of their time. Domestication of plants and animals has led to the production of surplus food which formed the basis for civilizations. Early civilization in different parts of the world has domesticated different species of plants for various purposes. Based on their utility, the economically useful plants are classified into food plants, fodder plants, fibre plants, timber plants, medicinal plants, and plants used in paper industries, dyes and cosmetics. Selected examples of economically important plants for each category are discussed in this chapter.

## Food plants
Currently about 10,000 food plants are being used of which only around 1,500 species were brought under cultivation. However, food base of majority of the population depends only on three grass species namely rice, wheat and maize.

### Cereals
The word cereal is derived from Ceres, which according to the Roman mythology denotes “Goddess of agriculture”. All cereals are members of grass family (Poaceae) that are grown for their edible starchy seeds. The prominence of cereals as food plants is due to the following attributes:

- Greater adaptability and successful colonisation on every type of habitat.
- The relative ease of cultivation
- Tillering property that produce more branches which results in higher yield per unit area.
- Compact and dry grains that they can be easily handled, transported and stored without undergoing spoilage.
- High caloric value that provides energy. 
  
The nutrients provided by cereals include carbohydrates, proteins, fibres and a wide range of vitamins and minerals. Cereals can be classified into two different types based on their size namely Major Cereals and Minor Cereals.

#### Major Cereals

**Why do popcorn pops?** 

![popcorn](popcorn.png "")

Endosperm in corn consists of two type namely soft and hard. In popcorn soft endosperm constitutes most part of the grain surrounded by thin layer of hard endosperm. When heated, the internal starch and protein are converted into gelatinous substances and when pressure mount further, the soft endosperm expands and explodes reversing the grain and the gelatinous starch are converted into foam, which readily solidifies outside and convert into crispy, tasty popcorn.  
```

### Sugars

![Sugars](10.9.png "")

We experienced sweetness while eating the stems of sugarcane, roots of sugar beet, fruits of apple and while drinking palmyra sap. This is due to the different proportions of sugars found in it. Sugar is the generic name for sweet tasting soluble carbohydrate, which are used in foods and beverages. Sugars found in sugarcane and palmyra make them ideal for efficient extraction to make commercial sugar.

**Sugarcane**

### Oil Seeds
Why fried foods are tastier than boiled foods? There are two kinds of oils namely, essential oils and vegetable oils or fatty oils. The essential oils or volatile oils which possess aroma evaporate or volatilize in contact with air. Any organ of a plant may be the source of essential oil. For example, flowers of Jasmine, fruits of orange and roots of ginger. The vegetable oils or non-volatile oils or fixed oils that do not evaporate. Whole seeds or endosperm form the sources of vegetable oils.

## Traditional Systems of Medicines
India has a rich medicinal heritage. A number of Traditional Systems of Medicine (TSM) are practiced in India some of which come from outside India. TSM in India can be broadly classified into institutionalized or documented and **non-institutionalized
or oral traditions. Institutionalized Indian systems include Siddha and Ayurveda which are practiced for about two thousand years. These systems have prescribed texts in which the symptoms, disease diagnosis, drugs to cure, preparation of drugs, dosage and diet regimes, daily and seasonal regimens. Non- institutional systems, whereas, do not have such records and or practiced by rural and tribal peoples across India. The knowledge is mostly held in oral form. The TSM focus on healthy lifestyle and healthy diet for maintaining good health and disease reversal.

**Siddha system of medicine** Siddha is the most popular, widely practiced and culturally accepted system in Tamil Nadu. It is based on the texts written by 18 Siddhars. There are different opinions on the constitution of 18 Siddhars. The Siddhars are not only from Tamil Nadu, but have also come from other countries. The entire knowledge is documented in the form of poems in Tamil. Siddha is principally based on the **Pancabūta** philosophy. According to this system three humors namely **Vātam,** **Pittam** and **Kapam** that are responsible for the health of human beings and any disturbance in the equilibrium of these humors result in ill health. The drug sources of Siddha include plants, animal parts, marine products and minerals. This system specializes in using minerals for preparing drugs with the long shelf-life. This system uses about 800 herbs as source of drugs. Great stress is laid on disease prevention, health promotion, rejuvenation and cure.

**Ayurveda system of medicine** 
Ayurveda supposed to have originated from Brahma. The core knowledge is documented by **Charaka,** **Sushruta** and **Vagbhata** in compendiums written by them. This system is also based on three humor principles namely, Vatha, Pitha and Kapha which would exist in equilibrium for a healthy living. This system Uses more of herbs and few animal parts as drug sources. Plant sources include a good proportion of Himalayan plants. The **Ayurvedic** **Pharmacopoeia** of India lists about 500 plants used as source of drugs.

**Folk system of medicine** 
Folk systems survive as an oral tradition among innumerable rural and tribal communities of India. A consolidated study to document the plants used by ethnic communities was launched by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India in the form of All India Coordinated Research Project on Ethnobiology. As a result about 8000 plant species have been documented which are used for medicinal purposes. The efforts to document in several under-explored and unexplored pockets of India still continue. Major tribal communities in Tamil Nadu who are known for their medicinal knowledge include **Irulas, Malayalis, Kurumbas, Paliyans** and **Kaanis**. Some of the important medicinal plants are discussed below.

## Medicinal Plants
India is a treasure house of medicinal plants. They are linked to local heritage as well as to global-trade. All institutional systems in India primarily use medicinal plants as drug sources. At present, 90% collection of medicinal plants is from the non-cultivated sources. Growing demand for herbal products has led to quantum jump in volume of plant materials traded within and across the countries. Increasing demand exerts a heavy strain on the existing resources. Now efforts are being made to introduce cultivation techniques of medicinal plants to the farmers.

Medicinal plants play a significant role in providing primary health care services to rural and tribal people. They serve as therapeutic agents as well as important raw materials for the manufacture of traditional and modern medicines. Medicinally useful molecules obtained from plants that are marketed as drugs are called Biomedicines. Medicinal plants which are marketed as powders or in other modified forms are known as Botanical medicines. In this chapter you will be learning about a few medicinal plants that are commonly used in Tamil Nadu. All these plants are commonly available in and around dwelling places and can be easily cultivated in home gardens.

**Patenting Of Turmeric** 
University of Mississippi medical center, USA was granted a patent for wound healing property of Turmeric in 1995. The patent was granted both for oral and topical applications and provides an exclusive right to sell and distribute. Since the use of turmeric to heal wounds is a common domain knowledge in India, the Government of India has decided to fight against the patent through the Indian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). CSIR collected documentary evidences from various literature to prove that the knowledge on wound healing property of turmeric existed in India for a long time and provided the evidences to the United States Patent and Trade mark Office (USPTO). Based on the evidences the patent was revoked by USPTO. Hence the traditional knowledge (TK) on turmeric was safeguarded from Bio piracy. viral properties. It is one of the traditional medicines used for wound healing.

Entrepreneurial Botany is the study of how new businesses are created using plant resources as well as the actual process of starting a new business. An **entrepreneur** is someone who has an idea and who works to create a product or service that people will buy, by building an organization to support the sales. **Entrepreneurship
is now a popular topic for higher secondary students, with a focus on developing ideas to create new ventures among the young people. Vast opportunities are there for the students of Botany. In the present scenario students should acquire ability to merge skills and knowledge in a meaningful way. Converting botanical knowledge into a business idea that can be put into practice for earning a livelihood is the  

much-needed training for the students. This part of chapter is aimed to help the students to acquire such skills with practical knowledge to start a few activities of entrepreneurship.

### Mushroom cultivation
Malnutrition caused by the lack of adequate protein and other nutrients in daily diet of people is becoming a major health hazard in developing countries. Under such circumstances, mushroom being a rich source of protein and other nutrients can be a part and parcel of every day’s food. Mushrooms are the **fruiting body** of edible fungi and is the most priced commodity among vegetables, not only because of its nutritive value but also for its characteristic aroma and flavor. M u s h r o o m s are also called **white vegetable**. M u s h r o o m cultivation has great scope in India and in other developing c o u n t r i e s . M u s h r o o m c u l t i v a t i o n activities can play an important role in supporting the local economy. Selling mushroom in a local market form a source of additional income to the family.

![Mushroom Cultivation](10.22.png "")

 **Steps involved in mushroom cultivation**
- The straw used for composting should be ripe and golden-yellow in colour. It should be cut into 2-4 inches and properly sterilized.
- The culture space should be clean and the ventilators and windows should be covered with fine wire mesh to prevent the entry of flies and birds.
- The culture space should be sprayed with 0.1% Nuvan and 5% Formalin, two days prior to spawning and transferring to bags to cropping rooms.
- The spawn used for mushroom should be free from contaminations. Bags should be filled with 8 kg of wet straw.
- During spawning running temperature and relative humidity should be maintained 200C to 300C, 75 to 85% respectively.
- Proper watering should be done when the growth coverings are removed. There should not be dry patches on blocks. Excess watering must be avoided.
- About 20 cm gap should be maintained in between two bags or blocks.
- Picking must be done as their caps become 10 – 12 cm by twisting.

Two kinds of mushrooms are cultivated namely **button** and **oyster**.

### Single Cell Protein (SCP) Production

Single-cell proteins are the dried cells of microorganism, which are used as protein supplement in human foods or animal feeds. Microorganisms that can be used for the production of SCP have the capacity to synthesize proteins rapidly than higher living organisms. Microorganisms like algae, fungi, yeast and bacteria are used for this purpose. Here you will learn about the production of SCP from an algae, _Spirulina_.


![Production of _Spirulina_](10.23.png "")

**Small scale biomass production of _Spirulina_.**

It requires an aquarium, air pump, nutrients and _Spirulina_ mother culture.

- Take a 30 litre capacity aquarium and fill half of it with water.
- Check if any heavy metal concentration or fluorine or calcium carbonate in water.
- Fill the tank with water and add nutrients preferably **zarrouk medium**. (Add half of the required nutrients first and add another half later).
- To aerate the culture, fix the air pump (avoid centrifugal pump) after adding nutrients.
- Add the mother culture to the aquarium. For every 1 liter of water add 4 gm. mother culture.
- Place it in sunlight for 10-12 hrs. every day. - After a week check the culture and add more
water leave it for one more week, till the biomass becomes dark green.
- Use a very fine cloth and harvest the algae. - Water can be reused in aquarium. 
- Dry the algae for later use.

Single cell protein has a high nutritive value due to higher protein, vitamin, essential amino acids and lipid content. Hence it can form a good protein supplement. However it cannot completely replace the conventional protein sources due to their high nucleic acid content and slower in digestibility. They may result in allergic reactions.

### Seaweed Liquid Fertilizer
Seaweed is rich in trace elements and potassium, which makes it ideal to add to compost in its raw state, to work in as a mulch, or to create a liquid fertilizer. This is easy to do. Seaweed fertilizer releases about 60 nutrients from which plants can benefit.

- Collect the seaweed that is not too stinky.
- Rinse the seaweed to remove the excess salt.
- Fill a bucket to three quarters way with water. Add as much seaweed as will fit and leave to soak.
- Stir the seaweed mix every two to four days. 
- Allow to soak for several weeks to months.
So that the fertilizer grows stronger and stronger over time. (Make sure to keep the brew somewhere so that its odour will not affect the daily household.)
- It is ready for use once it no longer carries a smell of ammonium.
- When it is ready, use as a fertilizer for plants and garden beds (soil). (It should be diluted with water at a minimum of three parts to one).

![Preparatio](10.24.png "")

Liquid seaweed extract enhances healthy growth of plants, flowers and vegetables. Regular use will help plants to withstand environmental stress, pests and disease attack. It can be used as a foliar spray for fruit, flower, vegetable crops as well as for shrubs and trees. It stimulates healthy growth for all plants.

### Organic farming
Organic farming is an alternative agricultural system in which plants/crops are cultivated in natural ways by using biological inputs to maintain soil fertility and ecological balance thereby minimizing pollution and wastage. Indians were organic farmers by default until the green revolution came into practice.

Use of biofertilizers is one of the important components of integrated organic farm management, as they are cost effective and renewable source of plant nutrients to supplement the chemical fertilizers for sustainable agriculture. Several microorganisms and their association with crop plants are being exploited in the production of biofertilizers. Organic farming is thus considered as the movement directed towards the philosophy of **Back to Nature.**

**I. Organic Pesticide** Pest like aphids, spider and mites can cause serious damage to flowers, fruits, and vegetables. These creatures attack the garden in swarms, and drain the life of the crop and often invite disease in the process. Many chemical pesticides prove unsafe for human and the environment. It turns fruits and vegetables unsafe for consumption. Thankfully, there are many homemade, organic options to turn to war against pests.

**Preparation of Organic Pesticide**

Refer figure: 10.24

**II. Bio-pest repellent** Botanical pest repellent and insecticide made with the dried leaves of _Azadirachta indica_

**Preparation of Bio-pest repellent** - Pluck leaves from the neem tree and chop

the leaves finely. - The chopped up leaves were put in a 50-liter

container and fill to half with water; put the lid on and leave it for 3 days to brew.

- Using another container, strain the mixture which has brewed for 3 days to remove the leaves, through fine mesh sieve. The filtrate can be sprayed on the plants to repel pests.
- To make sure that the pest repellent sticks to the plants, add 100 ml of cooking oil and the same amount of soap water. (The role of  
the soap water is to break down the oil, and the role of the oil is to make it stick to the leaves).
- The stewed leaves from the mixture can be used in the compost heap or around the base of the plants.

### Terrarium 
Can portable miniature indoor greenery be commercially sold?
A terrarium is a collection of small plants growing in a transparent, sealed container. Terrariums are easy to make, low maintenance gardens, and it can survie indefinitely with minimal water. **How to make a terrarium? Prepare the Container**: Collect whatever interesting glassware you have or source your container from a store and clean it thoroughly. Plan how to arrange the plants inside the glassware.

![Terrarium](10.25.png "")

**Add Drainage Layers**: To create a false drainage layer, fill the bottom with pebbles so that water can settle and does not flood. The depth of the pebbles depends on the size of the container. 
**Add the Activated Charcoal**: Cover the pebbles with charcoal to improve the quality of the terraria by reducing bacteria, fungi and odors. 
**Add Soil**: Add enough soil so that the plant roots will have enough space to fit and grow. 
**Plant**: Select the desired plant such as_, Caralluma spp, Asperagus spp, Portulaca spp, Begonia spp,_ and _Chlorophytum spp_; trim the roots if they are too long. Dig a pit using a stick, and place the plants’ roots in it. Add more soil around the top and compact the soil down around the base of the plant. Place little plants in the container and try to keep them away from the edges of the container, so that the leaves do not touch the sides. After planting add accessories like a layer of moss (dried or living), little figurines (old toys, glass beads, stones) or a layer of miniature rocks. This is the little green world 
**Cleaning and Watering**: Wipe if there is any dirt along the sides of the container. Give the terrarium a little bit of water and enjoy the beautiful miniature living world on your table or in your living room. Ready made terrariums can fetch a good price as indoor garden objects or as gift articles.

### Cultivation of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants
Globalization has brought opportunities and challenges in all business sectors. Government of India has identified medicinal and aromatic plants as one of the sectors that can make India a global leader in the 21st century owing to the treasure of about **8,000** medicinal and **2,500 aromatic plants that can provide large number of consumer products with national and international demand. Medicinal plants synthesize a number of secondary metabolites with pharmacological properties through secondary metabolism. The chemicals isolated from medicinal plants are used in traditional and biomedicine systems to treat diseases of both humans and animals. But most of the medicinal and aromatic plants are still wild collecting.

Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) has developed a number of high yielding varieties and processing technologies to promote cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants. Profitable cultivation of medicinal plants can be practiced by the entrepreneurs along with traditional agriculture horticulture crops. They can be profitably intercropped in plantations. Cultivation of medicinal/aromatic plants offers following advantages:

- Generate employment through development of ancillary industries.
- Foreign exchange earnings through exports.
- Crops are not damaged by domestic animals or by birds.
- Technologies are farmer and eco-friendly.

**I. Cultivation of Medicinal Plant - _Gloriosa superba_**

**Economically useful part** – Seed, Rhizome. **Major constituents -** Colchicine (0.5-0.7%) and Colchicoside **Uses - Cures gout, anti-inflammatory,** anticancer.  


[_Gloriosa ](10.26.png "")

superba_ **Soil and Climate:** Red loamy soils are well suited for cultivation. Glory lily is cultivated in Tamil Nadu mainly in the parts of Tirupur, Dindigul, Karur and Salem districts covering an area of 2000 hectare. **Planting**: Planting is distributed from June – July. Plough the field 2 -3 times and add 10 tons of Farmyard Manure during last ploughing. Trenches of 30 cm depth are formed and tubers are planted at 30 – 45 cm spacing. The vines are trained over support. **Irrigation:** Irrigation should be given immediately after planting. Subsequent irrigation is given at 5 days intervals of time. **Harvest:** Pods are harvested at 160 – 180 days.

**Summary** 
Early civilization in different parts of the world has domesticated different species of plants for various purposes. Based on their utility, the economically useful plants are classified into food plants, fodder plants, fibre plants, timber plants, medicinal plants, and plants used in paper industries, dyes and cosmetics.

However, food base of majority of the population depends on very few Cereals, Millets, Pulses, Vegetables, Fruits, Nuts, Sugars, Oil seeds, Beverages, Spices and Condiments.

Oils can be classified into two types namely, essential oils and vegetable oils. Fatty acids in oil may be saturated or unsaturated. The oil yielding plants are groundnut, sesame, sunflower, coconut and mustard. The oils are used in cooking, making soaps and other purposes. Beverages contain alkaloids that stimulate central nervous system. Non alcoholic beverages are coffee, tea and cocoa. Spices were used throughout the world for several years. Cardamom is ‘Queen of Spices’ used for flavouring confectionaries and beverages. Black pepper is King of Spices.

Botanically a fibre is a long, narrow, thick walled cell. It is classified based on uses: textile fibres, brush fibres, plaiting fibres and

filling fibres. Cotton, Jute and Coconut are fibre yielding plants. Teak, Rosewood, and Ebony are woods used for making furniture. Rubber is produced from the latex of Hevea brasiliensis. Paper production is a Chinese invention. Dyes have been used since ancient times. Indigo was extracted from the leaves of Indigofera. The orange dye henna is from the leaves of Lawsonia. Cosmetics have a high commercial value and have become chemical based industrial products. Perfumes are volatile and aromatic in nature, manufactured from essential oils which are found at different parts of the plant. Medicinal plants serve as therapeutic agents. Medicinally useful molecules obtained from these plants are marketed as drugs are called Biomedicines. Whereas phytochemicals from some of the plants which alter an individual’s perceptions of mind by producing hallucination are known as psychoactive drugs. Thus plantsplay a vital role in the lives of people throughout the world. Entrepreneurial Botany is the study of how new businesses are created using plant resources as well as the actual process of starting a new business. Mushrooms are the fruiting body of edible fungi and is the most priced commodity among vegetables.

Single-cell proteins are the dried cells of microorganism, which are used as protein supplement in human foods or animal feeds. Microorganisms like algae, fungi, yeast and bacteria are used for this purpose.

A terrarium is a collection of small plants growing in a transparent, sealed container. Bonsai is the art and science of dwarfing and shaping of a tree. Specialty materials like essential oils and pharmaceuticals, are obtained from plants. Many species of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) are cultivated for such industrial uses, but most are still wild collected.
