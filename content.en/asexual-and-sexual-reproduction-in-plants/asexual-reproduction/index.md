The reproduction method which helps to perpetuate its own species without the involvement of gametes is referred to as asexual reproduction.

Lower plants, fungi and animals show different methods of asexual reproduction**.** Some of the methods include, formation of Conidia (_Aspergillus_ and _Penicillium_); Budding (_Yeast_ and _Hydra_); Fragmentation (_Spirogyra_); production of Gemma (_Marchantia_); Regeneration (_Planaria_) and Binary fission (Bacteria) (Refer chapter 1 of Unit I of class XI). The individuals formed by this method is morphologically and genetically identical and are called **clones**. Higher plants also reproduce asexually by different methods which are given below:
