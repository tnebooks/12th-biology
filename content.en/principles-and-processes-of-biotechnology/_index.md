Biotechnology is the science of applied biological processes. In other words it is science of development and utilization of biological processes, forms and systems for the benefit of mankind and other life forms. The term biotechnology was coined by Karl Ereky, a Hungarian Engineer in 1919 and has been extended to include any process in which organisms, tissues, cells, organelles or isolated molecules such as enzymes are used to convert biological or other raw materials to products of greater value.
