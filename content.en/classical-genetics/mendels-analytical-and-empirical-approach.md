Mendel chose two contrasting traits for each character. So it seemed logical that two distinct factors exist. In F1 the recessive trait and its factors do not disappear and they are hidden or masked only to reappear in ¼ of the F2 generation. He concluded that tall and dwarf alleles of F1 heterozygote segregate randomly into gametes. Mendel got 3:1 ratio in F2 between the dominant and recessive trait. He was the first scientist to use this type of quantitative analysis in a biological experiment. Mendel’s data is concerned with the proportions of offspring.

Mendel’s analytical approach is truly an outstanding scientific achievement. His meticulous work and precisely executed breeding experiments proposed that discrete particulate units of heredity are present and they are transmitted from one generation to the other. Now they are called as genes. Mendel’s experiments were well planned to determine the relationships which govern hereditary traits. This rationale is called an empirical approach. Laws that were arrived from an empirical approach is known as empirical laws.
